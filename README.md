# Bookstrap-Portfolio

Week 3 Front End Skills Bootcamp Challenge 

## Description

This exercise is a part of the third challenge for the Front End Skills Bootcamp.

It required a completion of a series of tasks, including updating the portfolio style website that was created fot he previous week. Bookstrap should be used and the project should include a photo or an avatar of oneself, along with links to sections such as about me and my skills, my work and ways to contact.

Further requirements include for the navigation links to work correctly and scroll to the corresponding sections, for the images to work correctly and take the user to that deployed application.

Finally, the page is meant to be responsive with minimal use of media queries.

This challenge helped me understand how to use Bookstrap.
